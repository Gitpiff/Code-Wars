//Given two non empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.
//A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't neccessarily adjacent in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array. For instance the numbers [1, 3, 4] form a subsequence of the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and so do the numbers [2, 4]. Note that a single number in an array and the array itself are both valid subsequences of the array.

const isValidSubsequence = (array, subsequence) => {

};

console.log(isValidSubsequence([5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10],[1, 6, -1, 10]));
