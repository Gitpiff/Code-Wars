//We are given an array -asteroids- of integers representing asteroidsin a row.
//For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and it's sign represent it's direction
//positive meaning moving right, negative meaning moving left. Each asteroid moves at the same speed.
//Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions, if two asteroids meet the smaller one will
//explode. If both are the same size then both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the same
//direction will never meet

function collision(asteroids){
    //We only should track asteroids that are moving in opposite directions
    //See which ones will collide and in what order
