// Write a function fib that takes in a number argument, n, and returns the n-th number of the Fibonacci sequence.

// The 0-th number of the sequence is 0.

// The 1-st number of the sequence is 1.

// To generate further numbers of the sequence, calculate the sum of previous two numbers.

// Solve this recursively.
