// Write a function, nonAdjacentSum, that takes in an array of numbers as an argument. The function should return the maximum sum of non-adjacent elements in the array. There is no limit on how many elements can be taken into the sum as long as they are not adjacent.

const nonAdjacentSum = (nums) => {
    
};

const nums = [2, 4, 5, 12, 7];
console.log(nonAdjacentSum(nums));
