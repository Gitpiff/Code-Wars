// Write a function, maxPathSum, that takes in a grid as an argument. The function should return the maximum sum possible by traveling a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. You may only travel through the grid by moving down or right.

// You can assume that all numbers are non-negative.

const maxPathSum = (grid) => {
    // todo
};

const grid = [
    [1, 3, 12],
    [5, 1, 1],
    [3, 6, 1],
];

console.log(maxPathSum(grid));
