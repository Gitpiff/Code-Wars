// Write a function tribonacci that takes in a number argument, n, and returns the n-th number of the Tribonacci sequence.

// The 0-th and 1-st numbers of the sequence are both 0.

// The 2-nd number of the sequence is 1.

// To generate further numbers of the sequence, calculate the sum of previous three numbers.

// Solve this recursively.
