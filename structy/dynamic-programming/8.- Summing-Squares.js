// Write a function, summingSquares, that takes a target number as an argument. The function should return the minimum number of perfect squares that sum to the target. A perfect square is a number of the form (i*i) where i >= 1.

// For example: 1, 4, 9, 16 are perfect squares, but 8 is not perfect square.

// Given 12:

// summingSquares(12) -> 3

// The minimum squares required for 12 is three, by doing 4 + 4 + 4.

// Another way to make 12 is 9 + 1 + 1 + 1, but that requires four perfect squares.


const summingSquares = (n) => {
    // todo
};

console.log(summingSquares(8));
