// Write a function sumPossible that takes in an amount and an array of positive numbers. The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not it is possible to create the amount by summing numbers of the array. You may reuse numbers of the array as many times as necessary.

// You may assume that the target amount is non-negative.

const sumPossible = (amount, numbers) => {
    // todo
};


console.log(sumPossible(8, [5, 12, 4]))
