// Write a function, isPrime, that takes in a number as an argument. The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not the given number is prime.

// A prime number is a number that is only divisible by two distinct numbers: 1 and itself. 2 is the smallest prime number

// For example, 7 is a prime because it is only divisible by 1 and 7. For example, 6 is not a prime because it is divisible by 1, 2, 3, and 6.

// You can assume that the input number is a positive integer.

// const isPrime = (n) => {
//     //Iterate through "n" trying to find if "n" is divisible by any other number than 1 or "n"
//     //First we need to iterate through the number
//     //Start the for loop at 2 up to "< n" less than "n" since we know n is divisible by  itself, and we start the loop at 2 and not 1 because all numbers are divisible by 1
//     //Find if its divisible by any other number other than 1 or itself, if it is return false.
 //by starting i at 2 and running the loop before i === n, we eliminate the need of checking 1 and n, we know if n is divisible by 1 and n we have a prime number
//     if(n <2){
//         return false    //if n is equal to 1, that means that n is not a prime number
//     }


//     for(let i = 2; i < n; i ++){
//         if(n % i === 0){    //if n can be divided by any number between 2 and n,
//             return false    //then n is not a prime number
//         }
//     }

//     return true     //We don't need to return an else statement, we know if n can pass
//                     //the previous conditional, then n is a prime number
// }


const isPrime = (n) => {
    //base case
    if (n < 2) return false;
    //we can use the square root of n to make our iterations a lot shorter
    for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(n); i ++) {
      if (n % i === 0) {
        return false;
      }
