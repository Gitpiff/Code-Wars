//Write a function, "mergeSort", that takes in an array of numbers as an argument. The function should return a new array containing elements of the original array sorted in ascending order. Your function must implement the merge sort algorithm.


//Divide an conquer, make sure to use MAth.floor when dividing so we always get a whole number
//divide the array
//store in 2 var the left side and right side of it
//we'll need a helper function to help us merge


const mergeSort = (nums) => {

};

console.log(mergeSort([10, 4, 42, 5, 8, 100, 5, 6, 12, 40]));
