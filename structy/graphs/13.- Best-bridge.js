// Write a function, bestBridge, that takes in a grid as an argument. The grid contains water (W) and land (L). There are exactly two islands in the grid. An island is a vertically or horizontally connected region of land. Return the minimum length bridge needed to connect the two islands. A bridge does not need to form a straight line.

const bestBridge = (grid) => {
    
};

const grid = [
    ["W", "W", "W", "L", "L"],
    ["L", "L", "W", "W", "L"],
    ["L", "L", "L", "W", "L"],
    ["W", "L", "W", "W", "W"],
    ["W", "W", "W", "W", "W"],
    ["W", "W", "W", "W", "W"],
];

console.log(bestBridge(grid))
