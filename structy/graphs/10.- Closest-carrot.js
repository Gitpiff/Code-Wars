// Write a function, closestCarrot, that takes in a grid, a starting row, and a starting column. In the grid, 'X's are walls, 'O's are open spaces, and 'C's are carrots. The function should return a number representing the length of the shortest path from the starting position to a carrot. You may move up, down, left, or right, but cannot pass through walls (X). If there is no possible path to a carrot, then return -1.

const closestCarrot = (grid, startRow, startCol) => {

        const [ row, col, distance ] = queue.shift();
    
        if (grid[row][col] === 'C') return distance;
    
        const deltas = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]];
