//Write a function, "shortestPath", that takes in an array of edges for an undirected path and two nodes (nodeA, nodeB). The function should return the length of the shortest path between A and B. Consider the length as the number of edges in the path, not the number of nodes. If there's no path between A and B, then return -1.

const shortestPath = (edges, nodeA, nodeB) => {
    
}
