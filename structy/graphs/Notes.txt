-A graph is a collection of nodes -"circles" with data inside of them- and edges -connections between a pair of nodes-
-Directed Graph has arrowheads on the edges pointing at certain direction or flow, we can only move in the direction
 of the edges, think of it as a one way street.
-Undirected Graph has no directionality to it, so we can move freely between nodes, think of it as a two way street.
-Neighbor nodes is any node accesible through an edge obeying the direction of the edge.
-Adjancency list is a preffered way to represent graph information, typically hash maps are used, in JS objects.
    -Use constant time that has a key-value pair mapping
-Depth First Traversal uses a stack FILO
-Breadth Frist Traversal uses a queue FIFO
