//Write a function, "longesPath" that takes in an adjancency list for a directed acyclic graph. The function should return the length of the longest path within the graph. A path may start and end at any two nodes. The lenght of a path is considered the number of edges in the path not the number of nodes.

const longesPath = (graph) => {

};

const graph = {
    a: ['c', 'b'],
    b: ['c'],
    c: []
  };
  

console.log(longesPath(graph))
