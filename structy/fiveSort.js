//Write a function, "fiveSort", that takes in an array of numbers as an argument. The function should rearrange elements of the
//array such that all 5s appear at the end. Your function should perform this operation in-place by mutating the original
//array. The function should return an array. Elements that are not 5 can appear in any order in the output, as long as
//all 5s are at the end of the array.

const fiveSort = (nums) => {

console.log(fiveSort([1,4,5,6,5,7,5,8,5]))
